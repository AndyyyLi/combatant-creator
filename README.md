# Personal Project: Combatant Creator

## User Audience and Application Functionality

Combatant Creator is a simple character designing game for players who like to personalize their playable avatar
before taking them into battle! Ideally the character would face off against opponents after designing their character, 
but due to time constraints I chose to focus on just the customization phase.
Combatant Creator allows the user to make their own character by selecting from a variety of different items to
equip which prepares them for battle! Users are able to create their character by choosing ***one*** item from each of
the following categories:

- Weapon
- Spell
- Armour

Each item has its own **name, description, and stat changes**, and each item type has its own **special features**.
Each category is *separate* from each other, and the user can freely navigate back and forth between them.
There is also a section that *summarizes* what the user's character has currently equipped, which also shows **all of 
the character's stats**. From there they can also *finalize* their character, at which they can name their character 
before finishing and completing the game.

## Inspiration

I've always been a huge fan of video games, and I hope to go into video game programming in the future, so 
when I first started thinking of ideas for this project I immediately wanted to do something related to video games.
I figured if I designed something related to games, it would be more applicable if I presented it to a future employer
from a game company! As I mentioned above, I had originally envisioned an application that would include both the
creation of a character as well as the battle between them and an opponent, but I have more interest in the 
customization of the character so I decided to focus on that. 
I love the concept of personalizing in game characters because they feel more unique to me as a player, and this is a 
feature that is present in every game I've played, from choosing cosmetics and weapons in Team Fortress 2 
to picking my favourite character skin in League of Legends, thus I would be very interested in creating a
character designing application myself!
